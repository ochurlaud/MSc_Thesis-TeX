\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my supervisor Andreas Sch√§licke who has always been available to discuss the progress of my work, and managed to come on weekends and very early Monday mornings to attend the tests on the storage ring; Dennis Engel who has always had time to take me to the machines and explain to me in detail the history of such and such choices technology or process, and who took part in most implementation design deliberation. Both of them followed very closely the progress of the thesis, helping me understand the complex historical software and hardware stack involved in the correction, debug my programs, etc. They were also very patient with my German, which is still far from being perfect, but which I nevertheless really improved in this time.

I furthermore would like to thank Professor Raisch and Professor Jankowiak for providing me with this great opportunity and experience.

I would also like also to express my gratitude to the operators who were always kind enough to refill the storage ring when I defocused and threw the electron beam into the wall.

Lastly, I must warmly thank my friend Maxim who gave me some worthy resources in control theory, and some breaks when some algorithms refused to obey me. I finally cannot forget all the ones who read the drafts of my thesis, correcting my English and asking for more detailed explanations when I was too obscure.
