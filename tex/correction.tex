\chapter{Orbit correction}
\label{sec:correction}

\section{Motivation}
The accelerators are designed so that the particles follow a given path, which is defined in the case of synchrotrons by the successive bendings involved by the magnets. As the precision of the positioning of the magnets is limited, some errors may destabilize the orbit and increase the dispersion of the particles around the theoretical orbit. In addition, the environment produces perturbations: for instance the 50~Hz of the main power, some not perfectly isolated magnetic sources.

In order not to lose electrons in the walls of the vacuum chamber but also to increase the brightness of the synchrotron radiations (and therefore to have focused electron beams), all these residual misalignment and magnetic field errors must be corrected.



\section{Monitoring and correction instruments}
To be able to correct the orbit or localize perturbations, some tools must be employed.

\subsection{Beam Position Monitors}
The position of the beam in a given direction is monitored with beam position monitors (BPM). 

Several types of BPMs exist, but the important characteristics of the one used at BESSY~II are that they provide a method
\begin{itemize}
	\item which is non invasive (it does not affect the beam or negligibly)
	\item which outputs an electric signal proportional to the distance of the beam from an arbitrary point.
\end{itemize}

This last property means that the measured value must always be subtracted by a reference value.

The raw values output by the BPMs are thus never considered and every orbit position value given (also called BPM value by misuse of language) is always, at position~$s$ and time~$t$
\begin{equation}
\Delta x_\text{BPM}(s,t) = x_\text{BPM}(s,t) - x_\text{BPM,ref}(s)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Correctors}
To correct the orbit, BESSY~II uses dipoles, also called correctors (CM) disposed around the orbit. Each dipole contributes to correcting in a given direction. 

\subsection{Monitor and corrector numbers}
The number of monitors and correctors is quite important. Because the correction method used is based on an inversion problem (see \cref{sec:response_matrix}), it is important to have an over-constrained problem. Else a perfect correction would be reached at monitor positions but unconstrained (and thus potentially arbitrary bad) elsewhere.

Therefore the number of BPMs is chosen quite greater than the number correctors.

In BESSY~II there are 
\begin{itemize}
	\item 128~BPMs, measuring both horizontal ($\text{BPM}_x$) and vertical ($\text{BPM}_x$) direction,
	\item 48~CMs for the horizontal direction ($\text{CM}_x$) and 64 for the vertical one ($\text{CM}_y$).
\end{itemize}

\section{Some documented methods}
Several global corrections methods are well documented in the literature. Local orbit bumps (presented in \cref{sec:orbit_bump}) allow local correction and are used to change the path of the orbit (during the injection time for example). The most common ones are the best corrector method and the response matrix method (see \cref{sec:most_effective_corr,sec:response_matrix}), as they provide a global correction, over the whole orbit. 

\subsection{Local orbit bumps}
\label{sec:orbit_bump}
Using local orbit bumps is a basic method that gives total control on the orbit local modification to the operator.

\subsubsection{Principle}
Adding a simple dipole on the path of a particle will focus or defocus it. As the particles must eventually return to the planned orbit, a series of dipoles can be set one after the other to design an arbitrary path. \Cref{fig:local_bump} shows a minimal example, where the black points represent the magnets.

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{\label{fig:local_bump}Local bump with 3 magnets}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{In practice}
This solution is used for instance to shift a part of the orbit during particle injections, in order to prevent collisions. This can also be used to counter a known localized perturbation which source cannot be removed.

It is indeed very efficient to locally shift the orbit. However it cannot be used for correction, as it modify the path of the orbit itself, introducing maybe other perturbations.

\subsection{Most effective corrector method}
\label{sec:most_effective_corr}
This method is based on the fact that orbit shifts are often caused by strong localized disturbances. Its goal is to correct particularly each disturbance.

\subsubsection{Principle}
Given a distorted orbit, the optimal gain for each corrector is calculated by a mean square error algorithm (see \cref{eq:gain_bestcorr} and \cite{book:wille}). The corrector which provides the best correction is selected: it is the most effective corrector.

Let's assume that the $i$th corrector, at position $s_i$, has the optical parameters $\beta_i$, $\alpha_i$ and $\Psi_i$, and that $m$ monitors are set around the orbit with parameters $\beta_j$, $\alpha_j$ and $\Psi_j$, and read a displacement $u_j$ from the reference orbit ($1 \leq j \leq m$).

The strength $\kappa_i$ of the field at the position $s_i$ is obtained minimizing the function
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:gain_bestcorr}
    f_i(\kappa_i) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{m} (u_j-x_{ij}(\kappa_i))^2 
                  = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{m} (u_j- \kappa_i h_{ij})^2
\end{equation}

with, if $\Delta \Psi_{ij} := \Psi_j-\Psi_i$,

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:hij}
    x_{ij}(\kappa_i) &= \kappa_i h_{ij} \nonumber\\
                     &= \kappa_i \frac{\sqrt{\beta_i \beta_j}}{2}
                         \left[
                             \frac{\cos(\Delta \Psi_{ij}) - 2\alpha_i \sin(\Delta\Psi_{ij})}
                                  {\tan (\pi Q)} + \sin (\Delta\Psi_{ij})
                         \right].
\end{align}

It follows that 
\begin{equation}
    \kappa_i = \frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^m u_j h_{ij}}{\sum\limits_{j=1}^m h_{ij}^2}
\end{equation}

The $i$th corrector is attributed the gain $-\kappa_i$ to compensate the field.

\subsubsection{Iterative version}
When the most effective corrector is found, the process is reiterated on the corrected orbit with the remaining correctors. By doing this until all corrector are used (or that adding a correction does not improve the orbit) a comprehensive correction is reached.

\subsubsection{Practical issue}
The problem of this method is that each corrector must be tested once, and this for each iteration: the initialization of the correction is long and is then fixed. Moreover, the correction is less efficient than the other ones presented here~\cite{book:wille}.

\subsection{Inversion of the response matrix}
\label{sec:response_matrix}
This section is mainly based on~\cite{book:wille}, \cite{art:decker-1991} and \cite{art:plouviez-1999}.

\subsubsection{Inverse problem}
This correction is based on solving the following inverse problem: the expected orbit being known, how to set the correctors in order to achieve it? To solve it, the response matrix $\mat{S}$ is introduced.

The response matrix $\mat{S}$ is defined by the equation $\vec{X} = \mat{S}\, \vec{\Theta}$ where $\vec{\Theta}$ is the \emph{kick vector} (i.e. the vector of strength of the field generated by each corrector) and $\vec{X}$ the vector of \emph{orbit change}. If the accelerator has $M$ monitors and $N$ correctors, then $\mat{S}$ is a $M \times N$ matrix. $\mat{S}$ is often termed \emph{forward} or \emph{observation matrix} because it describes the effects of a given phenomenon. Indeed, each coefficient $S_{ij}$ of the matrix is the orbit change at the position $s_i$ (of the $i$th monitor), for a kick of unity 1 at the position $s_j$ (of the $j$th corrector).

Inversing the response matrix will provide the correction to apply. Since it's very common to have more monitors than correctors, the matrix is not square. A \emph{singular value decomposition} (SVD) is used on the matrix to provide a pseudo-inversion $\mat{S}^*$ of $\mat{S}$.

Using the SVD also allows to use only the most significant singular values in the correction. This prevents to over-correct the orbit, by not considering less significant values that can result of noise in the monitors during the measure, or numerical artifacts for instance.

The correction can then be performed
\begin{equation}
\vec{\Theta} = \mat{S}^* \vec{X}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Acquisition of the response matrix}
Before solving the inverse problem, the response matrix must first be determined. This can be achieved in two different ways: by describing the magnet structure and explicitly calculating the matrix or by acquiring it in an experimental way.

\paragraph{Calculation of the response matrix}
The matrix can be theoretically calculated by using the accelerator model and physics. This was already used in \cref{sec:most_effective_corr} and using the same calculations leads to setting, for the $i$th monitor and $j$th corrector,
\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = h_{ij}
\end{equation}
with $h_{ij}$ as defined in \cref{eq:hij}.

The main flaw of this method is that it is only a model which hence may not exactly represent the reality. Some misalignments of magnets or external magnetic perturbations would not be taken in account. It's however a good first approach.

\paragraph{Experimental acquisition of the response matrix}
A more common and precise way of constructing the response matrix is empirical: it suffices to give a unitary value to a corrector and to read the monitors to obtain a column $\mat{S}$. Doing so for each corrector provides the whole matrix.


\section{State of the art at BESSY II}
\label{sec:correction_state_of_art}
\subsection{The correction}
BESSY II currently uses a Fast Orbit Feedback (FOFB) which is based on a PID correction (proportional response with gain $K_p$, integral response with gain $K_i$ and derivative response with gain $K_d$) and the response matrix inversion. The full process goes as presented in \cref{fig:block_correction}.

\end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{\label{fig:block_correction}The correction process}
\end{figure}

The control value at correction cycle $n$ is the differential orbit 
\begin{equation}
 \Delta \vec{X}(n) := \vec{X}(n)-\vec{X}_\text{ref}
\end{equation}
which is expected to be 0. The correction provided by the weighted response matrix is then processed
\begin{equation}
\Delta \vec{\Theta}_\text{t}(n) :=  \left[ \mat{S}^{-1} \cdot \Delta \vec{X}(n) \right] \odot \vec{W}
\end{equation}
(with $\odot$ the point-wise multiplication and $\vec{W}$ the vector of weights) and modulated by the PID correction. The ideal PID has the form
\begin{equation}
H_{PID}(s) = K_p + \frac{K_i}{s} + K_d \cdot s 
\end{equation}
or, with the z transform (calculated with Euler's method),
\begin{equation}
H_{PID}(z) = K_p + \frac{K_i}{1-z} + K_d \cdot (1-z)
\end{equation}
which yields
\begin{equation}
\Delta \vec{\Theta}(n) =  K_p \cdot \Delta \vec{\Theta}_\text{t}(n) + K_i \cdot \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1}\Delta \vec{\Theta}_\text{t}(k) + K_d \cdot \left[\Delta \vec{\Theta}_\text{t}(n) - \Delta \vec{\Theta}_\text{t}(n-1)\right].
\end{equation}

The real correction is eventually the accumulation of all corrections
\begin{equation}
\vec{\Theta}(n) = \vec{\Theta}(n-1) - \Delta \vec{\Theta}(n).
\end{equation}

For stability reasons, the PID was always implemented as a proportional corrector ($K_i$ ad $K_d$ being zero) which was behaving as a proportional integrator (PI) because of the last accumulation. \todo{implemented in the future? or see section XXX}

\remark The PID gains is not exactly as presented here: to prevent a too violent correction that might destabilize the current in the ring, the proportional gain is increased every correction cycle by 1\% until it reaches its nominal value.

\subsection{Technical overview}

The correction is naturally automatized. Because the read/write actions should be really fast, a specific infrastructure was designed. This is represented on \cref{fig:cbox_mbox}. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.85\linewidth]{img/mBox_cBox}
    \caption{\label{fig:cbox_mbox}cBox and mBox: the correction infrastructure in BESSY II}
\end{figure}

All elements are connected to a reflective memory (RFM), which provides a high speed and low latency interface. This memory space is split in specified divisions to prevent data collisions: one part contains the configuration, a second the orbit values and the last one the correction values.

The following actors are playing a role in the process:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the \textbf{cBox} which controls (= \textit{c}) the correction. It defines when to read the values of the BPMs and when to write the new correction values, it provides initializations values. The operators are communicating with this process to configure the correction.
    \item the \textbf{mBox} which does the math (= \textit{m}) of the correction. When allowed by the cBox, it reads the BPMs values, do the maths to define the new correction values (multiplication with the response matrix, PID correction) and write them to the communication bus. This process also publish the values it reads and writes so that client programs can subscribe to this data stream and reuse the values internally.
    \item the \textbf{Input-Output Controllers (IOCs)} write the correction values to the power supplies commands when they are available.
    \item the \textbf{power supplies (PS)} provide a given power to the corrector magnets.
\end{itemize}

After having received the authorization to run from the cBox, the mBox process starts. It first do its full initialization, which only happens on start (the response matrix, the reference orbit, the PID parameters, etc. cannot change while the mBox process is running), and starts the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter). From this time, they will write new orbit values to the RFM at a rate of \SI{150}{\hertz}.

The mBox waits for the ADC interruption to read the new orbit data from the RFM. The correction is then calculated (in Amperes) and the values are converted in a format easily transmissible (basically unsigned integers). This data is written back to RFM and an interruption is sent to inform the other elements that the new values are available. This is read by the IOCs that relay to the power supplies alimenting the corrector magnets. 

This defines a real time process, repeated at the frequency of \SI{150}{\hertz}.

The duration of each step is as following:\todo{TIMES}
\begin{enumerate}
\item orbit value acquisition: \SI{00}{\milli\second}
\item correction computation: \SI{00}{\milli\second}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Improvement of the correction for harmonic perturbations}
The correction presented until now only provides a temporal correction. It has no possibility to correct a specific harmonic or to perform in the spectral domain.

A simple extension of this method is to analyze a given harmonic of the orbit, and consider the Fourier coefficient of each monitor as the complex amplitude of the orbit
\begin{equation}
	\forall f \in \mathbb{R}, \qquad c_f = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T x(t) e^{-j 2 \pi f t} dt
\end{equation}
or, in the digital domain,
\begin{equation}
\forall f \in \left[0, \frac{Fs}{2}\right], \qquad c_f = \frac{2}{N} \sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1} x(k) e^{-j 2 \pi f \frac{k}{F_s}}
\end{equation}
where $F_s$ is the sampling frequency, $f = \frac{1}{T}$ the frequency of interest and N the number of samples.

Because of the digitalization, $f$ must be a multiple of $\frac{F_s}{N}$, which can be a problem here. The complex amplitude is therefore used as initial value in a least-square-error fit-curve algorithm that will provide a hopefully more precise amplitude if the frequency of interest did met the precedent condition.

This provides an complex orbit $\Delta\vec{X}_f$ for the harmonic $f$. From there the corrector values can be calculated with the traditional method
\begin{equation}
\Delta\vec{\Theta}_f = \mat{S}^{1}\, \Delta\vec{X}_f   \in \mathbb{C}.
\end{equation}

To apply the correction, an oscillation must finally be generated with the obtained parameters. This is, for the $i$th corrector
\begin{equation}\label{eq:th_dyn_corr}
\forall t \in  \mathbb{R}, \qquad y(t) = \left| \Delta\vec{\Theta}_f(i) \right| \cdot \cos\left(2 \pi f t - \arg\left(\Delta\vec{\Theta}_f(i)\right)\right).
\end{equation}

The main problem with this method is that the generated signal phase must be synchronized with the time the correction parameters were measured. This was possible only for perturbations for which the source was already known and could be used as reference signal.

\subsection{Example of the 10 Hz perturbation}
The \SI{10}{\hertz} perturbation has a well known source which is the booster power supply (pre-accelerator). This perturbation has such a great impact on the orbit spectrum and could be used as a validation case.

A coil was used to measure the field generated by a magnet powered by the same source as the booster. It provides a \SI{10}{\hertz} reference which is synchronized with the perturbation.

The orbit and the reference signal were measured during the exact same time. Both were analyzed with the method presented above. Instead of using \cref{eq:th_dyn_corr}, the reference signal was used and its phase and amplitude where changed for each corrector with the help of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. Because the sampling frequency is \SI{150}{\hertz}, a FIR with 15 taps for the $i$th corrector can be designed as follow
\begin{equation}
	h_i(n) = \frac{\left| \Delta\vec{\Theta}_f(i) \right|}{\left|A_{10}\right|} \cdot \cos\left(2\pi\cdot \frac{10}{150} n - \left[\arg\left(\Delta\vec{\Theta}_f(i)\right) - \phi_{10}\right] \right),\quad n \in 0..14
\end{equation}
where $A_{10}$ and $\phi_{10}$ are respectively the amplitude and the phase of the reference signal.

This can then be applied to the reference signal $x_{10}$: for the $i$th corrector, the dynamic correction is
\begin{equation}
y[n] = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{14} h[k] x_{10}[n-k]
\end{equation}

\section{System and correction simulation}
One difficulty in improving the current correction process is that machine time is expensive: tests cannot be done very often. A wrong correction can indeed destabilize the orbit or worse, lose the electrons in the vacuum chamber walls, and thus it cannot be tested when the storage ring is on service or other scientists do experiments or measurements for their own research. However, has presented previously, the process is complex and it must be sure that every actors will play correctly in an improved process. Simulating the whole environment is expected to mitigate this.

\subsection{System identification}
The first step in the model is to represent the storage ring. This could be done analytically, by writing the magnet equations and deriving the full differential equations that bind the correction to orbit displacement. However, it would take a full master thesis to realize a good model, as there are very different types of components all around the orbit, with some non linear behavior.

Instead a system identification is conducted. A brief theoretical explanation will be followed by the actual results.

\subsubsection{Theoretical background}
\todo{Organize it so that it looks like control theory}
A linear time invariant system (LTI) is described by its transfer function
\begin{equation}
	G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}
\end{equation}
where a $Y(s)$ is the Laplace transform of the system output and $U(s)$ the Laplace transform of its input.
