\chapter{Orbit correction}
\label{sec:correction}

\section{Motivation}
The accelerators are designed so that the particles follow a given path, which is defined in the case of synchrotrons by the successive bending imposed by dipole magnets. Quadrupole magnets are additionally needed to provide focusing and guarantee the closing of the orbit. As the precision of the positioning of the magnets is limited, some errors may destabilize the orbit and increase the deviation of the particles around the theoretical orbit.

In addition, the environment produces perturbations: for instance the 50~Hz of the main power, some imperfectly isolated magnetic sources (like the booster at \SI{10}{\hertz}). \Cref{fig:fft_no_correction} shows the spectrum of the beam displacement from the reference orbit before correction.

	\caption{\label{fig:fft_no_correction} Spectrum of the beam motion, without correction (vertical)}
\end{figure}

In order not to lose electrons in the walls of the vacuum chamber but also to increase the brightness of the synchrotron radiations (and therefore to have focused electron beams), all these residual misalignment and magnetic field errors must be corrected.

The most classical correction methods will be presented here, before explicitly describing the case of BESSY~II and the improvement proposed during this thesis.

\section{Monitoring and correction instruments}
To be able to correct the orbit or localize perturbations, some tools must be used.

\subsection{Beam Position Monitors}
The position of the beam in a given direction is monitored with \emph{beam position monitors} (BPM).

Several types of BPMs exist, but the important characteristics of the type used at BESSY~II are that
\begin{itemize}
	\item it is a non invasive method (it does not affect the beam or in a negligible way)
	\item it outputs an electric signal proportional to the distance of the beam from an arbitrary point.
\end{itemize}

This last property means that the measured value must always be subtracted by a reference value.

The raw values output by the BPMs are thus never considered and every orbit position value given (also called BPM value by misuse of language) is always at position~$s$ and time~$t$
\begin{equation}
\Delta x_\text{BPM}(s,t) = x_\text{BPM}(s,t) - x_\text{BPM,ref}(s)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Correctors}
To correct the orbit, BESSY~II uses dipole magnets, also called \emph{corrector magnets} (CM) positioned around the storage ring. Each dipole contributes to correcting in a given direction, at a specific position.

\subsection{Monitor and corrector numbers}
The number of monitors and correctors is quite important. Because the correction method used is based on an inversion problem (see \cref{sec:response_matrix}), it is important to have an over-constrained problem. In the opposite case, a perfect correction would be always reached at monitor positions but unconstrained (and thus potentially arbitrary bad) elsewhere.

Therefore, the number of BPMs is set quite greater than the number of correctors.

At BESSY~II there are
\begin{itemize}
	\item 108~BPMs, measuring both horizontal ($\text{BPM}_\text{x}$) and vertical ($\text{BPM}_\text{y}$) direction,
	\item 48~CMs for the horizontal direction ($\text{CM}_\text{x}$) and 64 for the vertical direction ($\text{CM}_\text{y}$).
\end{itemize}

\section{Orbit correction methods}
Several global correction methods are well documented in the literature. Local orbit bumps (presented in \cref{sec:orbit_bump}) allow local correction and are used to change the path of the orbit (during the injection time for example). The most common ones are the \textit{best corrector method} and the \textit{response matrix method} (see \cref{sec:most_effective_corr,sec:response_matrix}), as they provide a global correction over the whole orbit.

\subsection{Local orbit bumps}
\label{sec:orbit_bump}
Using local orbit bumps is a basic method that gives the operator a total control on local orbit modifications.

\subsubsection{Principle}
Adding a simple dipole on the path of a particle will bring it closer or push it away. As the particles must eventually return to the planned orbit, a series of dipoles can be set one after the other to design an arbitrary path. \Cref{fig:local_bump} shows a minimal example, where the black points represent the magnets, and the dashed line the original orbit. Each magnet $M_i$ has the position $s_i$, where the phase is $\Psi_i$ and the beta function  $\beta_i$. The orbit motion at this position is described by the vector $\vec{x}_i = (x_i , x'_i)$.

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{\label{fig:local_bump}Local bump with 3 magnets (inspired by~\cite{book:wille}, Fig~3.47)}
\end{figure}

The strengths $\kappa_1$, $\kappa_2$, $\kappa_3$ of each magnets can be calculated with the formalism introduced in \cref{sec:beta_func}, \cref{eq:motion_transfert_matrix} in order to achieve the right displacement and respect the closed orbit condition. The following conditions must be fulfilled (closed orbit):
\begin{equation}
\vec{x}_1 = \dbinom{0}{\kappa_1} \qquad \text{and} \qquad
\vec{x}_3 = \dbinom{0}{-\kappa_3}
\end{equation}

The orbit motion at $s_3$ is the superposition of the effects of $M_1$ and $M_2$ alone. It can thus be written
\begin{equation}
\vec{x}_3 = \mat{M}_{1 \rightarrow 3} \vec{x}_1 + \mat{M}_{2 \rightarrow 3} \dbinom{0}{\kappa_2}
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation*}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -\kappa_3 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \kappa_1 \end{pmatrix} +
\begin{pmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} \\ b_{21} & b_{22} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \kappa_2 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Solving this system of equations and replacing the coefficients of the matrix by their expression in \cref{eq:motion_transfert_matrix} leads to the values of $\kappa_2$ and $\kappa_3$ in function of $\kappa_1$ (see \cite{book:wille}, p.130 for the exact equations). This can allow an arbitrary displacement of the orbit at a given position. This can be extended to a version with $N$ magnets, which allows the free setting of $N-2$ parameters ($x$ or $x'$). This is extensively described in \cite{book:wille}.

\subsubsection{In practice}
This solution is used, for instance, to shift a part of the orbit during particle injections, in order not to disturb already stored particles. It can also be used to counter a known localized perturbation of which source cannot be removed.

It is indeed very efficient to locally shift the orbit. However, it cannot be used for correction, as that needs a precise knowledge of the optics of the ring, which is not available (some devices have no theoretical optic model). Further more, it would be an iterative method as the correction would need to be calculated and applied for each orbit segment.

\subsection{Most effective corrector method}
\label{sec:most_effective_corr}
This method is based on the fact that orbit shifts are often caused by strong localized disturbances. Its goal is to correct each particular disturbance.

\subsubsection{Principle}
Given a distorted orbit, the optimal gain for each corrector is calculated by a mean square error algorithm (see \cref{eq:gain_bestcorr} and \cite{book:wille}). The corrector which provides the best correction is selected: it is the most effective corrector.

Let's assume that the $i$th corrector, at position $s_i$, has the optical parameters $\beta_i$, $\alpha_i$ and $\Psi_i$, and that $m$ monitors are set around the orbit with parameters $\beta_j$, $\alpha_j$ and $\Psi_j$, and read a displacement $u_j$ from the reference orbit ($1 \leq j \leq m$).

The strength $\kappa_i$ of the field at the position $s_i$ is obtained minimizing the function
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:gain_bestcorr}
    f_i(\kappa_i) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{m} (u_j-x_{ij}(\kappa_i))^2
                  = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{m} (u_j- \kappa_i h_{ij})^2
\end{equation}

with, if $\Delta \Psi_{ij} := \Psi_j-\Psi_i$,

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:hij}
    x_{ij}(\kappa_i) &= \kappa_i h_{ij} \nonumber\\
                     &= \kappa_i \frac{\sqrt{\beta_i \beta_j}}{2}
                         \left[
                             \frac{\cos(\Delta \Psi_{ij}) - 2\alpha_i \sin(\Delta\Psi_{ij})}
                                  {\tan (\pi Q)} + \sin (\Delta\Psi_{ij})
                         \right].
\end{align}

It follows that
\begin{equation}
    \kappa_i = \frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^m u_j h_{ij}}{\sum\limits_{j=1}^m h_{ij}^2}
\end{equation}

The $i$th corrector is attributed the gain $-\kappa_i$ to compensate the field.

\subsubsection{Iterative version}
When the most effective corrector is found, the process is reiterated on the corrected orbit with the remaining correctors. By doing this until all correctors are used (or until adding a correction does not improve the orbit), a comprehensive correction is reached.

\subsubsection{Practical issue}
The problem of this method is that each corrector must be tested once, and this for each iteration: the initialization of the correction is long and is then fixed. Moreover, the correction is less efficient than the other ones presented here~\cite{book:wille}.

\subsection{Response matrix}
\label{sec:response_matrix}
This section is mainly based on~\cite{book:wille}, \cite{art:decker-1991} and \cite{art:plouviez-1999}.

\subsubsection{Inverse problem}
This correction is based on solving the following inverse problem:
\begin{center}
\textit{With the expected orbit being known, how must the correctors be set\\ in order to achieve this orbit?}
\end{center}

To solve this problem, the response matrix $\mat{S}$ is introduced. It is defined by the equation $\vec{X} = \mat{S}\, \vec{\Theta}$ where $\vec{\Theta}$ is the \emph{kick vector} (i.e. the vector of strength of the field generated by each corrector) and $\vec{X}$ the vector of \emph{orbit change}. If the accelerator has $M$ monitors and $N$ correctors, then $\mat{S}$ is a $M \times N$ matrix. $\mat{S}$ is often termed \emph{forward} or \emph{observation matrix} because it describes the effects of a given phenomenon. Indeed, each coefficient $S_{ij}$ of the matrix is the orbit change at the position $s_i$ (of the $i$th monitor), for a kick of unity 1 at the position $s_j$ (of the $j$th corrector).

Inversing the response matrix will provide the correction to apply. Since it's very common to have more monitors than correctors, the matrix is not square. A \emph{singular value decomposition} (SVD) is used on the matrix to provide a pseudo-inversion $\mat{S}^*$ of $\mat{S}$.

Using the SVD also makes it possible to use only the most significant singular values in the correction. This prevents the orbit from being over-corrected, by not considering less significant values that can result of noise in the monitors during the measuring, as well as numerical artifacts or incorrections in the response matrix.

The correction can then be performed
\begin{equation}
\vec{\Theta} = \mat{S}^* \vec{X}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Acquisition of the response matrix}
Before solving the inverse problem, the response matrix must first be determined. This can be achieved in two different ways: by describing the magnet structure and explicitly calculating the matrix, or by acquiring it in an experimental way.

\paragraph{Calculation of the response matrix}
The matrix can be theoretically calculated by using the accelerator model and physics. This was already used in \cref{sec:most_effective_corr} and using the same calculations leads to setting, for the $i$th monitor and $j$th corrector,
\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = h_{ij}
\end{equation}
with $h_{ij}$ as defined in \cref{eq:hij}.

The main flaw of this method is that it is only a model which may not exactly represent the reality. Some misalignments of magnets or external magnetic perturbations would not be taken intp account. It is, however, a good first approach.

\paragraph{Experimental acquisition of the response matrix}
A more common and precise way of constructing the response matrix is empirical: it suffices to give a unitary value to a corrector and to read the monitors to obtain a column $\mat{S}$. Doing so for each corrector provides the whole matrix.


\section{State of the art at BESSY II}
\label{sec:correction_state_of_art}
BESSY II currently implements a Fast Orbit Feedback (FOFB), which is based on the response matrix inverse. The correction algorithm will be first described in \cref{sec:correction_sa_corr}, and current choices will be discussed by references found in literature. A technical overview will then be provided in \cref{sec:correction_sa_technical}, presenting the actual processes taking part in the correction.

\subsection{The correction}
\label{sec:correction_sa_corr}
Using the response matrix to correct the orbit is quite common \cite{book:wille,art:plouviez-1999,art:li-2001}. However, as already highlighted in \cref{sec:response_matrix}, the matrix never perfectly represents the orbit and because of noises in the environment, it is not sufficient. In general only the largest singular values are used and some additional corrections are needed in the frequency domain.

To cope with these additional requirements, a PID correction (proportional response with gain $K_p$, integral response with gain $K_i$ and derivative response with gain $K_d$) is used at BESSY~II. It also deals with the delays introduced by the process between the time the orbit is read by the BPMs and the moment the correction is actually applied \cite{art:plouviez-1999}.

The full process goes as presented in \cref{fig:block_correction}.

\end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{\label{fig:block_correction}The correction process used at BESSY~II}
\end{figure}

The control value at correction cycle $n$ is the differential orbit
\begin{equation}
 \Delta \vec{X}[n] := \vec{X}[n]-\vec{X}_\text{ref}
\end{equation}
which is expected to be close to 0. The correction provided by the weighted response matrix is then processed
\begin{equation}
\Delta \vec{\Theta}_\text{t}[n] :=  \left(\mat{S}^{-1} \cdot \Delta \vec{X}[n] \right) \odot \vec{W}
\end{equation}
(with $\odot$ the point-wise multiplication and $\vec{W}$ a vector of weights) and modulated by the PID correction. The ideal PID in the Laplace form is described with
\begin{equation}
H_{PID}(s) = K_p + \frac{K_i}{s} + K_d \cdot s
\end{equation}
or, with the z transform (calculated with Euler's method),
\begin{equation}
H_{PID}(z) = K_p + \frac{K_i}{1-z} + K_d \cdot (1-z)
\end{equation}
which yields
\begin{equation}
\Delta \vec{\Theta}[n] =  K_p \cdot \Delta \vec{\Theta}_\text{t}[n] + K_i \cdot \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1}\Delta \vec{\Theta}_\text{t}[k] + K_d \cdot \left(\Delta \vec{\Theta}_\text{t}[n] - \Delta \vec{\Theta}_\text{t}[n-1]\right).
\end{equation}

The real correction is eventually the accumulation of all corrections
\begin{equation}
\vec{\Theta}(n) = \vec{\Theta}[n-1] - \Delta \vec{\Theta}[n].
\end{equation}

For stability reasons, the PID was always implemented as a pure proportional corrector ($K_i$ and $K_d$ being set to zero). Indeed, because of the last accumulation, it was of course behaving like a proportional integrator (PI), which forbade the use of the other coefficients in the PID correction. In the simulations described in \cref{sec:correction_simulation}, a corrector PID can be implemented with more efficient coefficients. It is, however, important that the correction starts from an initial value known to be stable, so that the beam stays focused.

\subsection{Technical overview}
\label{sec:correction_sa_technical}
The correction is naturally automatized. Because the read/write actions should be really fast, a specific infrastructure was designed. This is represented on \cref{fig:cbox_mbox}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.85\linewidth]{img/mBox_cBox}
    \caption{\label{fig:cbox_mbox}cBox and mBox: the correction infrastructure at BESSY~II}
\end{figure}

All elements are connected to a reflective memory (RFM), which provides a high speed and low latency interface. This memory space is split in specified divisions to prevent data collisions: one part contains the configuration, a second the orbit values and the last one the correction values.

\paragraph{Actors}
The following actors are playing a role in the process:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{analog-to-digital converter (ADC)} reads the orbit displacement values from the BPMs and makes them available to the other actors.
    \item The \textbf{cBox} controls (= \textit{c}) the correction. It defines when to read the values of the BPMs and when to write the new correction values,    and it provides initializations values. The operators are communicating with this process to configure the correction.
    \item The \textbf{mBox} does the maths (= \textit{m}) of the correction. When allowed by the cBox, it reads the BPMs values, does the maths to define the new correction values (multiplication with the response matrix, PID correction) and writes them to the communication bus. This process also publishes the values it reads and writes so that client programs can subscribe to this data stream and reuse the values internally.
    \item The \textbf{input-output controllers (IOCs)} write the correction values to the power supplies commands when they are available.
    \item The \textbf{power supplies (PS)} provide a given power to the corrector magnets.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Process description}
After having received the authorization to run from the cBox, the mBox process starts. It first does its full initialization, which only happens upon start (the response matrix, the reference orbit, the PID parameters, etc. cannot change while the mBox process is running), and starts the ADC. From this time, the ADC will write new orbit values to the RFM at a rate of \SI{150}{\hertz}.

The mBox waits for the ADC interruption to read the new orbit data from the RFM. The correction is then calculated (in Amperes) and the values are converted in the DAC input format (basically unsigned integers). This data is written back to RFM and an interruption is sent to inform the other elements that the new values are available. This is read by the IOCs that relay to the power supplies powering the corrector magnets.

This defines a real time process, repeated at the frequency of \SI{150}{\hertz}.

The duration of each step is as following:
\begin{itemize}
\item orbit value acquisition (BPMs): 0.3 to \SI{1.7}{\milli\second}
\item correction computation: 0.5 to \SI{1}{\milli\second}
\item transmission of the correction date to the power supplies: 0.5 to \SI{1}{\milli\second}
\end{itemize}

\remark One of the side works done during this thesis was rewriting the whole mBox in C++ in a very object oriented way to allow a smaller computation time (the original one was written in \textsc{Matlab}), easier improvement and feature additions (like a dynamic correction, easier communication with external scripts, production/experimental modes, etc.). This is fully presented in \cref{apx:mbox}.

\subsection{Overview and needed improvements}
The results of this correction can be seen in \cref{fig:compare_fofb}: the low frequencies and most of the peaks are reduced, which is a real gain for the end users of the accelerator. These correction results where reached again after having rewritten the mBox in C++, which ensured that no dramatic regressions were introduced and allowed going forward.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/fft_no_corr}
        \caption{No correction}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{\label{fig:compare_fofb}Orbit motion spectrum: with and without FOFB (vertical, current: \SI{300}{\milli\ampere})}
\end{figure}

It must be noted that correction gain provides only a correction up to $\sim\!\SI{12}{\hertz}$, and increasing it would let the system become unstable. The presented correction is therefore not always sufficient and some specific frequencies (like for example 10, 17.5 or \SI{32}{\hertz}) must be corrected with a separate method dedicated to them, which would need to be added to the full correction process.

\section{Improvement of the correction for harmonic perturbations}
\label{sec:dyn_corr}
The correction presented until now, which already existed at BESSY~II, only provides a correction for the continuous component. It can be seen in \cref{fig:compare_fofb}, that the correction drastically reduces the perturbations in the lower frequencies (below \SI{10}{\hertz}) but other frequencies still have high components. This section will provide a method implemented during this thesis for a dedicated correction of harmonic perturbations.

\subsection{General method}
A simple extension of the previous method is to analyze a given harmonic of the orbit, and consider the Fourier coefficient of each monitor as the complex amplitude of the harmonic orbit of interest
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:orbit_extract}
	\forall f \in \mathbb{R}, \qquad X_f = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T x(t) e^{-j 2 \pi f t} dt
\end{equation}
or, in the digital domain,
\begin{equation}
\forall f \in \left[0, \frac{Fs}{2}\right], \qquad X_f = \frac{2}{N} \sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1} x(k) e^{-j 2 \pi f \frac{k}{F_s}}
\end{equation}
where $F_s$ is the sampling frequency, $f = \frac{1}{T}$ the frequency of interest and $N$ the number of samples.

This method is based on the decomposition of the signal in orthogonal functions. With the digitalization, the harmonic function are orthogonal only when the frequency $f$ is a multiple of $\frac{F_s}{N}$. This can be a problem here, as the frequency to analyze might be exactly \SI{10}{\hertz} (see \cref{sec:dyn_corr_ex_10Hz}) and not \SI{9.975}{\hertz} if $N=2000$, $F_s=\SI{150}{\hertz}$. The input signal should therefore have as many samples as possible so that the frequency of interest can be close to the precedent condition.

This approach provides a complex differential orbit $\Delta\vec{X}_f$ for the harmonic $f$. From there, the correction values can be calculated with the traditional method
\begin{equation}
\Delta\vec{\Theta}_f = \mat{S}^{*}\, \Delta\vec{X}_f   \in \mathbb{C}^n.
\end{equation}

To apply the correction, an oscillation must finally be generated with the obtained parameters. This is, for the $i$th corrector
\begin{equation}\label{eq:th_dyn_corr}
\forall t \in  \mathbb{R}, \qquad y_i(t) = \left| \Delta\Theta_{f,i} \right| \cdot \cos\left(2 \pi f t - \arg\left(\Delta\Theta_{f,i}\right)\right).
\end{equation}

The main problem with the method as presented here is that the generated signal phase must be synchronized with the time at which the correction parameters were measured. This is possible only for perturbations for which the source is already known and could be used as reference signal.

\subsection{Example of the 10 Hz perturbation}
\label{sec:dyn_corr_ex_10Hz}
The \SI{10}{\hertz} perturbation has a well known source -- the booster power supply (pre-accelerator). This perturbation has a great impact on the orbit spectrum, and could be used as a validation case.

A coil was used to measure the field generated by a magnet powered by the same source as the booster. It provides a \SI{10}{\hertz} reference, which is synchronized with the perturbation.

The orbit and the reference signal were measured during the exact same time. Both were analyzed with the method presented above. Instead of using \cref{eq:th_dyn_corr}, the reference signal was used and its phase and amplitude where changed for each corrector with the help of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. Because the sampling frequency is \SI{150}{\hertz}, a FIR with $N_\text{taps} = 15$ for the $i$th corrector can be designed as follow
\begin{equation}
	h_i[n] = \frac{2}{N_\text{taps}}\cdot \frac{\left| \Delta\Theta_{f,i} \right|}{\left|A_{10}\right|} \cdot \cos\left(2\pi\cdot \frac{f_{10}}{F_s} n - \left[\arg\left(\Delta\Theta_{f,i}\right) - \phi_{10}\right] \right),\quad n \in 0..N_\text{taps}-1
\end{equation}
where $A_{10}$ and $\phi_{10}$ are respectively the amplitude and the phase of the reference signal, $F_s=\SI{150}{\hertz}$, $f_{10}=\SI{10}{\hertz}$.

This can then be applied to the reference signal $x_{10}$: for the $i$th corrector, the dynamic correction is
\begin{equation}
y[n] = h * x_{10} [n] =  \sum\limits_{k=0}^{14} h[k] \cdot x_{10}[n-k]
\end{equation}

The result of the algorithm is shown in \cref{fig:compare_dyn_corr}. It can be seen that the perturbation is completely removed. Interestingly enough, the FIR filter needed an additional phase rotation of $-\frac{3}{4}\pi \text{~rad}$ to obtain a good result. It should be noted that the storage ring was filled with low current only.

\section{Summary}
In order to be sure that the electron beam remains focused and stable, a control process is needed. The concerned hardware and software stack at BESSY~II was first studied and the main actor (the mBox) rewritten in a more modern and expendable way. To the original correction was added a dynamic correction, that can correct static harmonic perturbations and almost completely remove them.
