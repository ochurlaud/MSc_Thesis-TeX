\section{Some documented methods}

Several corrections methods are well documented in the literature. The most common ones are the best corrector method, ...

\subsection{Best corrector method}
This is an iterative method.

Given an orbit distortion, the corrector which provides the best correction is selected and its gain is determined\todo{how?}. The new orbit is used as the next input, and the same process is applied with the remaining correctors. 

By doing this until all corrector are used (or that adding a correction does not change the quality\todo{quality?} of the orbit) a comprehensive correction is reached.
